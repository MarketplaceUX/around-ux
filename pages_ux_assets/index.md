# UX Design Assets

The prototype screens in this site were created using Axure. These Axure files were then published to [AxShare][1] and referenced from within this site. 

To produce the Screens pages of this site, the prototype was split into smaller files based on content area. [Download the zip file][2] to view the Axure files corresponding to each prototype screen.
