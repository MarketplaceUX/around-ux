### View Profile
* View Profile is accessible from many places in the app. Once on View Profile, user presses back arrow to return to previous screen.

* At the top of View Profile is content identifying the user whose Profile we're looking at.

* Below the user row content is divided into two sections: 1) History, and 2) Friends.


### History Tab
* Content and interaction are the same as for the History tab in [Tab Bar - My Profile][1].


### Friends Tab
* Content and interaction are the same as for the Friends tab in [Tab Bar - My Profile][1].
