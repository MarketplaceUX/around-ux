### Structure + Navigation

The Around application is an HTML5 Foursquare client from [Mozilla][1]. 

It's designed to illustrate key features of developing Open Web Apps and will serve as a reference application for the [Mozilla Developer Network][2]. In particular, the Around application is a good example of an app that uses geo-location, takes advantage of offline storage, and interacts with a 3rd-party API.
