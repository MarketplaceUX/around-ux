# User Experience Questions and Issues


### Task Confirmation
After completing certain tasks, we want to provide confirmation that the task was successful. This is currently represented as a toast. Could also be an inline message at the top of View Checkin that disappears after X seconds (or after user closes it). Whatever is easiest...

* On [View Checkin][1] - Add a Comment
* On [View Place][2] - Add a Tip


### Slow GPS 
Does including search functionality address this? Or do we need something more substantial for this sample app?

* On [Tab Bar - Checkin][3]


### Adding Friends from Services
Let's do whatever is easiest for this sample app. Maybe just one service? Or just phone contacts?

* On [Tab Bar - Profile][4]


### Sharing
I'm assuming that share via SMS/Email is built-in functionality. If it is, we can use that. Confirmation is a good idea though...something to indicate that the action completed successfully. Should be the same mechanism we choose to solve the above issue.

* On [View Place][2]

### Photo Uploading
Should we represent the Upload Photo functionality? I'm happy to leave it out. If we decide to leave the action out, let's remove the Upload a Photo button altogether.

* On [View Place][2]

### Outstanding Items
* Better errors - let's talk about what this means for UX.

* OpenStreetMaps attribution - anything further to do on this?
